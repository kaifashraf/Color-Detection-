# Color-Detection-
Color detection using Python and OpenCV involves identifying and isolating specific colors within an image or a video stream. We have written a code for detecting color of an object using OpenCV.
This repository contains code that demonstrates how to detect and isolate specific colors within images or video streams using the OpenCV library in Python.

Features:
Color Detection: Identify and isolate desired colors in real-time images or video.
Customizable Thresholds: Adjust color thresholds to fine-tune the detection process.
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-understand code structure with comments for clarity.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
